Codebase for FPL predicitons website for A-Level Computer Science project

This is a website that is targeted at FPL players who want data driven transfer reccomendations, and if needed a tool to make the transfers automatically.

The site provides detailed statistics for all players, including an exclusive xP metric for a players expected performance, and also provides customised reccomendations when given a username and password.

IGNORE ALL FILES AND DIRECTORIES OTHER THAN "FPLWizard", which contains the entire website codebase.
